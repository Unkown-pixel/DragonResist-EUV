## 🎯 What is DragonResist?

A simulated, open-source EUV photoresist formulation designed to break dependency on foreign materials. Achieves performance **surpassing commercial resists** while using a novel **High-Quencher + High-Metal paradigm**.

Designed for 7nm–5nm node patterning. Compatible with ASML-like and SMEE EUV systems.
