Polymer Backbone: 70.0%
  → Acrylate-norbornene copolymer with bound Hf-complex (6.3% Hf by wt of backbone)
  → + 2.0% gradient Tg modifier: Methacryloyloxypropyl POSS (copolymerized)

PAG: 12.0%
  → 11.0% Plasmonic iodonium (e.g., Merck PAG-7700)

Quencher: 7.5%
  → 7.0% Photo-decomposable quencher (e.g., TPS-Naphthol)
  → 0.5% LER buffer quencher: t-Butyl-protected phenol (slow-decomposing)

Metal: 8.5%
