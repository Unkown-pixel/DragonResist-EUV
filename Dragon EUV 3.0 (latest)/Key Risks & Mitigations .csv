Risk,Detection Method,Mitigation
Sensitizer PAG clustering,TEM after PEB,Pre-dissolve PAG blend + 0.1% PEG-400
TMAL-induced CD shift,CD-SEM dense vs. iso,Reduce TMAL to 0.05% if CD shift >1.5 nm
POSS self-assembly,AFM phase imaging,Ensure covalent copolymerization during synth
Hf-acrylate hydrolysis,In-line particle counter (0.05µm),Add 0.3% BHT; Karl Fischer H₂O <20 ppm
LER buffer quencher overdose,LER mapping (edge vs. center field),Reduce to 0.3% if LER <1.3 nm (over-smooth)
