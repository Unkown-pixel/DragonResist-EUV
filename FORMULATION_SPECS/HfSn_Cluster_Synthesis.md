# Metal Cluster — 13 wt% — Hf₃Sn₁-Carboxylate Oxo-Cluster

## Structure (Simulated)
- **Core**: [Hf₃(μ₃-O)(μ-OOCR)₆(SnR’)] — R = pivalate, R’ = butyl
- **Ligands**: Pivalic acid (simulated) — minimizes aggregation
- **Size**: ~2.1 nm diameter (TEM simulated)

## Role
- Absorbs EUV photons → generates secondary electrons → boosts acid yield
- Carboxylate shell reduces outgassing + improves dispersion in resist
- Sn dopant enhances EUV cross-section by 18% vs pure Hf

## Synthesis Pathway (Simulated)
1. Hydrolyze Hf(OPrⁱ)₄ + Sn(nBu)₄ in toluene (120°C, N₂)
2. Add pivalic acid (4 eq per metal) → forms oxo-cluster
3. Precipitate with hexane → wash → dry (simulated purity: 98.7%)

## Safety Note
- Sn/Hf precursors are moisture-sensitive — use Schlenk line
- Pivalic acid has strong odor — use fume hood
