# Polymer Backbone — 47 wt%

## Structure (Simulated)
- **Base**: Norbornene-carbonate copolymer
- **Functionalization**: 30% acrylate side chains for etch resistance
- **MW**: ~8,000 Da (simulated GPC)
- **Tg**: 145°C (simulated via MD)

## Role
- Provides mechanical stability for high-aspect-ratio features
- Resists plasma etch (high carbon backbone)
- Compatible with metal clusters (no phase separation)

## Synthesis Pathway (Simulated)
1. ROMP of norbornene-carbonate monomer (Grubbs 3rd gen catalyst)
2. Radical copolymerization with acrylate comonomer
3. End-capped with hydroxyl-terminated siloxane (0.5 mol%)

## Alternatives
- Styrene-maleic anhydride (lower cost, worse LER)
- Acrylate-lactone (higher sensitivity, worse collapse)
