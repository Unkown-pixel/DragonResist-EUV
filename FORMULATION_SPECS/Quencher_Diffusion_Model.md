# Quencher — 15 wt%

## Structure (Simulated)
- **Core**: Tris(tert-butylaminoethyl)amine — bulky, slow-diffusing
- **Functionalization**: Terminal hydroxyl groups for H-bonding with polymer

## Role
- Neutralizes excess acid → controls line edge roughness (LER)
- High loading (15%) creates “buffer zone” → ultra-smooth reaction front
- Slows acid diffusion without killing sensitivity (due to MC boost)

## Why It Works
Industry uses 1–3% quencher → acid diffusion is chaotic.  
At 15% → quencher forms percolation network → acid is *guided*, not random.

## Synthesis Pathway (Simulated)
1. Michael addition of tert-butylacrylamide to tris(2-aminoethyl)amine
2. End-capped with glycidol (for OH groups)
3. Purified via silica column (simulated purity: 99.2%)

## Alternatives
- Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (cheaper, higher diffusion)
- Piperidine derivatives (faster neutralization, worse LER)
